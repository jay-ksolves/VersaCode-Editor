## Reporting a Vulnerability

The VersaCode team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for helping us make VersaCode safe for everyone.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to our private security mailing list. We will get back to you as soon as possible, and we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue.

**To report a vulnerability, please email us at: [security@example.com]** (Note: This is a placeholder email. In a real project, this would be a dedicated security contact.)

Please include the following information in your report:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version of VersaCode you are using.
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will work with you to resolve the issue promptly. We will also publicly acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability has been patched.
